# RISCV-VDS-Workshop

Welcome to my repository for the **RISC-V VSD (VLSI System Design)** Workshop.  
This workshop explores RISC-V fundamentals, covering the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), processor design, and hands-on simulation.

📅 5-Days Learning Plan

📘 Day 1: Introduction to RISC-V and Tool Setup
- Overview of RISC-V ISA
- Installed necessary tools (Makerchip, Icarus Verilog, GTKWave)
- Explored how compilers translate C to assembly

🧠 Day 2: Writing RISC-V Assembly
- Learned basic RISC-V instructions (add, sub, li, etc.)
- Wrote simple RISC-V assembly programs
- Simulated on [Makerchip](https://makerchip.com/)

⚙️ Day 3: Processor Design Basics
- Introduction to pipelining and datapath
- Built a basic processor in TL-Verilog
- Understood how instructions flow in a pipeline

🛠️ Day 4: Simulation and Debugging
- Simulated processor on Makerchip
- Used waveforms to trace instruction execution
- Debugged code with real-time feedback

🚀 Day 5: Project and Wrap-up
- Created a mini project using RISC-V
- Summarized learning and challenges
- Explored further learning paths
